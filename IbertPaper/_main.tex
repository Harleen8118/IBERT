% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2021} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2021} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
% \newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
%\usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2021}
% to remove appendix
%\usepackage[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]{pagesel}



% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2021}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{\OURS: Integer-only BERT Quantization}

\begin{document}

\newcommand{\OURS}{\textsc{I-BERT}\xspace}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2021
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
